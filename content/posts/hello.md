Hello all. 

I didn't decide my resum√© here, then the thing I could do right now is to clarify my motivation for this Gohugo blog.

The blog generated for value writing is hosted on Github. A routine git work follows this:

```
hugo new posts/LoremIpsum.md
git init
git add LoremIpsum.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/binwoodsye/hugo.git
git push -u origin main
```

There would be a post to collect all errors and procedures on Git command. Before the issues collection let's come back to **value writing**, a reminder by ZHU Xiaochao. "Writing can cure," says he, "also realize thoughts into sentences and paragraphs more logically."

A man can isolate himself into his own world if he has thoughts only. On contrast, by writing he could practice reality checks on his thoughts.

That's why I've set up this blog site.
